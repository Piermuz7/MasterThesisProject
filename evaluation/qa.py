    The aim of IMPRINTS is to contribute to reduce loss of life and economic damage through the improvement of the preparedness and the operational risk management for Flash Flood and Debris Flow [FF/DF] generating events, as well as to contribute to sustainable development through reducing damages to the environment. To achieve this ultimate objective the project is oriented to produce methods and tools to be used by emergency agencies and utility companies responsible for the management of FF/DF risks and associated effects. Impacts of future changes, including climatic, land use and socioeconomic will be analysed in order to provide guidelines for mitigation and adaptation measures. Specifically, the consortium will develop an integrated probabilistic forecasting FF/ DF system as well as a probabilistic early warning and a rule-based probabilistic forecasting system adapted to the operational use by practitioners. These systems will be tested on five selected flash flood prone areas, two located in mountainous catchments in the Alps, and three in Mediterranean catchments. The IMPRINTS practitioner partners, risk management authorities and utility company managers in duty of emergency management in these areas, will supervise these tests. The development of such systems will be carried out using and capitalising the results of previous and ongoing research on FF/DF forecasting and warning systems, in which several of the partners have played a prominent role. One major result of the project will be a operational prototype including the tools and methodologies developed under the project. This prototype will be designed under the premise of its ultimate commercialization and use worldwide. The consortium, covering all the actors involved in the complex chain of FF & DF forecasting, has been carefully selected to ensure the achievement of this. Specific actions to exploit and protect the results and the intellectual property of the partners have been also defined.

    Energy consumption over the whole Building Life Cycle (BLC) is difficult to monitor and predict due to the complexity of the processes involved. Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a concept which has arisen to address the management and interoperability of the data exchanged between different computer aided tools employed at different stages the BLC, including design, construction, commissioning, operation, refurbishment and demolition. BIM therefore plays a key role in all aspects of energy management across the BLC. The W3C Data Activity makes use of Linked Data, which is a structured form of data storage, distributed across the web, and which is supported by tools to easily query that data. By integrating BIM into the wider web of data, building information can be queried alongside all other Linked Open Data (LOD) sources, which include data on materials and systems (e.g. sensor and state of building devices data) which make up the building, profiles of occupants, and information about weather patterns and regional and global energy prices. Together this information can make for more meaningful analysis of energy consumption and its relation to the localised costs of materials, systems and personnel in existing and future buildings. Therefore, by using BIM and LOD technologies EeB projects will be better able to exploit their results beyond their own particular stage in the BLC and as a result benefit from greater overall impact. The ‘SWIMing’ project will bring together existing EeB projects under clusters categorised by which stages of the BLC the project is applied and energy savings are achieved and the particular domains within those stages to facilitate knowledge sharing and increase the impact of project results. It will support making the project processes and the data produced by these processes publishable as linked data on the web and through this structured format (BIM-LOD), make data more accessible and less fragmented across the BLC

    FOrLedger, an innovative low-code development platform that allows software companies oriented to agrifood supply chain businesses to develop blockchain-based software quickly with minimal coding, minimizing the need for extensive coding experience. These applications support growers in the traceability and in the certification of food products by using the Blockchain technology and Smart Contracts. It helps them build transparency beyond the “one step down, one step up” traceability principle. Furthermore, it improves the integrity of product data and drives efficiencies for stakeholders. The novelty of FOrLedger lies in blockchain technology togetherwith model-driven techniques which is provided “as-a-service” facilitating its integration in any software application within supply chain environment. The blockchain technology allows to make safe and automatic all the transactions along the supply chain, increasing the high-quality production (in particular organic products), improving the environmental sustainability and guaranteeing transparency and safety to the final consumer. The blockchain was developed as a decentralised ledger which records transactions and stores this information on a global network in a manner which prevents it being changed at a future point. While initially adopted for its financial implications, the blockchains’ decentralised system has huge potential for the traceability of supply chains. The blockchain provides a neutral open platform, there is no third party needed to authorise transactions, but rather a set of rules all participants, both users and the operators of the system, must abide by. Blockchain technology is used as a form of proof: proof of existence, proof of ownership, proof of transaction, proof of exchange and proof of value. The blockchain has the potential to take the power of information from Big Food and place it into the hands of the direct customer.

    We propose a disruptive ICT concept strictly connected to SMEInst: Open Disruptive Innovation Scheme. In the field of genomics, sequencing technologies have drastically changed in the last few years and the output of complex data generated has outpaced the solutions available for analysis, integration and interpretation. RNA Sequencing has emerged as the number one technique in transcriptomics and thus the solution we propose is based on this. A.I.R.: Artificial Intelligence RNASeq is the first easy to use SaaS (Software as a Service) built with solid scientific methods. AIR is able to solve three important obstacles in the genomics field simultaneously: the informatics problem (specifically data storage, automatization of results and duration of analysis); the scientific problem (data interpretation and data integration, as well as providing new bioinformatic and statistical functions); the social problem (the lack of availability of skilled bioinformaticians). The overall objective of this project is to introduce a disruptive innovation that will allow researchers to perform transcriptomics data analysis easily, quickly and affordably. Given that AIR is already at TRL 7 of development, our specific objectives are to improve AIR’s current performance to take it to the final, gold TRL 9 stage and to carry out a feasibility study to launch AIR into the market. Economically speaking, we will assess if the investment required is sustainable compared to the expected market demand/ROI and quantify the upfront investment required to start a commercialization plan. We also need to evaluate the IP feasibility and assess the dissemination efforts required to successfully launch AIR into the market, and the organizational changes we must prepare for in order to sustain market demand. We are confident that AIR will change the paradigm of RNASeq data analysis. We also know that in order to achieve this quickly, we require a funding opportunity in line with the SMEInst budget.
