    "5 title of projects with abstract similar to: Many complex systems are characterized by multi-level properties that make the study of their dynamics and of their emerging phenomena a daunting task. The huge amount of data available in modern sciences can be expected to support great progress in these studies, even though the nature of the data varies. Given that, it is crucial to extract as much as possible features from data, including qualitative (topological) ones. The goal of this project is to provide methods driven by the topology of data for describing the dynamics of multi-level complex systems. To this end the project will develop new mathematical and computational formalisms accounting for topological effects. To pursue these objectives the project brings together scientists from many diverse fields including as topology and geometry, statistical physics and information theory, computer science and biology. The proposed methods, obtained through concerted efforts, will cover different aspects of the science of complexity ranging from foundations, to simulations through modelling and analysis, and are expected to constitute the building blocks for a new generalized theory of complexity.",

    The aim of IMPRINTS is to contribute to reduce loss of life and economic damage through the improvement of the preparedness and the operational risk management for Flash Flood and Debris Flow [FF/DF] generating events, as well as to contribute to sustainable development through reducing damages to the environment. To achieve this ultimate objective the project is oriented to produce methods and tools to be used by emergency agencies and utility companies responsible for the management of FF/DF risks and associated effects. Impacts of future changes, including climatic, land use and socioeconomic will be analysed in order to provide guidelines for mitigation and adaptation measures. Specifically, the consortium will develop an integrated probabilistic forecasting FF/ DF system as well as a probabilistic early warning and a rule-based probabilistic forecasting system adapted to the operational use by practitioners. These systems will be tested on five selected flash flood prone areas, two located in mountainous catchments in the Alps, and three in Mediterranean catchments. The IMPRINTS practitioner partners, risk management authorities and utility company managers in duty of emergency management in these areas, will supervise these tests. The development of such systems will be carried out using and capitalising the results of previous and ongoing research on FF/DF forecasting and warning systems, in which several of the partners have played a prominent role. One major result of the project will be a operational prototype including the tools and methodologies developed under the project. This prototype will be designed under the premise of its ultimate commercialization and use worldwide. The consortium, covering all the actors involved in the complex chain of FF & DF forecasting, has been carefully selected to ensure the achievement of this. Specific actions to exploit and protect the results and the intellectual property of the partners have been also defined.
