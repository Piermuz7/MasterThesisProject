    Project Description:
    This project aims to develop Safe and Sustainable by Design (SSbD) two-dimensional materials (2DM) technologies, ensuring their safe development, environmental sustainability, and societal acceptance. As the commercial use of 2DM increases, it is critical to evaluate human health and environmental impacts while establishing robust regulatory compliance frameworks for their safe integration into the market.
    Through multidisciplinary research and innovation, the project will focus on toxicity and eco-toxicity assessments, biocompatibility studies, and risk mitigation strategies for 2DM and 2DM-based composites. The project will contribute to regulatory assessment processes (OECD test guidelines, REACH compliance, authorisation pathways) by developing validated testing methodologies and supporting standardization efforts.
    The initiative will foster synergies with existing EU-funded projects, particularly within the Graphene and 2D Materials Flagship Initiative, while ensuring data interoperability and governance alignment. To enhance societal acceptance, the project will involve stakeholders from social sciences and humanities (SSH), facilitating public trust and regulatory approval.
    
    Project Objectives:
    • OBJ1: Develop Safe and Sustainable by Design (SSbD) two-dimensional materials (2DM) technologies to ensure safety, sustainability, and regulatory compliance.
    • OBJ2: Conduct comprehensive toxicity and eco-toxicity assessments for 2DMs, developing robust, validated assays to support regulatory approvals (OECD, REACH, authorisation pathways).
    • OBJ3: Investigate biocompatibility and safety of 2DM-based materials throughout their entire life cycle, addressing potential occupational and environmental health risks.
    • OBJ4: Develop safe-by-design methodologies, applying chemical and physical modifications to enhance 2DM safety while maintaining their functional properties.
    • OBJ5: Establish standardized validation processes to support regulatory assessment, ensuring transparent risk evaluation and best practices.
    • OBJ6: Facilitate societal acceptance of 2DM technologies by engaging SSH experts, addressing public concerns, ethical considerations, and industry transparency.
    • OBJ7: Strengthen collaborations with European research initiatives (e.g., Graphene Flagship, Horizon Europe projects), ensuring synergy and knowledge exchange.
    • OBJ8: Contribute to the governance and coordination of the Graphene Flagship Initiative, aligning research efforts with the Strategic Research and Innovation Plan (SRIP) for chemicals and materials.

    Recommend potential organisations suitable to form a consortium for the following project.

    Project Description:
    This project aims to advance the next generation of smart systems by developing agile, secure, and decentralized architectures for collaborative smart nodes with swarm intelligence. It will leverage Europe’s strengths in embedded sensors, devices, and wireless communication (both non-cellular and 5G networks) to create interoperable and energy-efficient IoT and cyber-physical ecosystems.
    The project will focus on developing dynamic programming environments for smart edge-connected nodes, reducing the complexity of programming and maintenance across the device-edge-cloud continuum. By introducing mesh architectures, decentralized intelligence, and AI-powered edge processing, the project will enable context-aware, autonomous, and scalable IoT solutions.
    Through proof-of-concept implementations in at least three real-world application areas (e.g., automated driving, healthcare, smart factories, utilities, farming, logistics, or smart cities), the project will demonstrate higher resilience, security, and trust in embedded AI applications. The initiative will also prioritize energy efficiency and contribute to the sustainable use of energy by optimizing edge computing performance and promoting renewable energy sources.
    
    Project Objectives:
    • OBJ1: Develop secure, decentralized, and agile architectures for collaborative smart nodes with swarm intelligence in cyber-physical ecosystems.
    • OBJ2: Create programming environments that simplify the deployment and maintenance of smart edge-connected nodes across device-edge-cloud infrastructures.
    • OBJ3: Design and implement open, dynamic environments and tools that support interoperability, open architectures, and vendor neutrality, fostering open-source adoption where appropriate.
    • OBJ4: Strengthen Europe’s leadership in next-generation smart systems by integrating smart sensors, embedded processors, and AI-powered edge computing into scalable IoT applications.
    • OBJ5: Develop and validate innovative mesh architectures with mixed topologies that enable tactile internet, real-time analytics, and context-aware interaction.
    • OBJ6: Demonstrate the resilience, security, and trustworthiness of distributed AI applications through real-world proof-of-concept implementations in at least three sectors.
    • OBJ7: Optimize energy efficiency of edge computing solutions and promote renewable energy integration to ensure the sustainable development of IoT ecosystems.
    • OBJ8: Align with global sustainable development goals (SDGs) by promoting energy-efficient, secure, and decentralized IoT and cyber-physical ecosystems.

With the increasing use of AI in cybercrime, digital investigations, and critical infrastructure protection, it is essential to develop trustworthy, ethical, and interoperable AI tools that support Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) across Europe.
    The initiative will establish a platform for AI-driven security solutions, ensuring seamless integration, continuous innovation, and end-user collaboration. It will also focus on cybersecurity measures to protect AI systems, advanced threat intelligence for cybercrime units, and ethical frameworks to prevent malicious AI usage. A key component is the development of secure, high-quality, and legally compliant training datasets to improve AI performance in security applications while addressing legal and ethical concerns.
    Through collaboration between LEAs, researchers, policymakers, and industry, this project will provide cutting-edge AI tools that reinforce Europe’s resilience against security threats and enhance the operational capacity of law enforcement agencies.
    
    Project Objectives:
    1. Develop AI-powered tools and solutions to support LEAs in crime prevention, digital investigations, and border security, including robotics, NLP, and automated threat detection.
    2. Establish an interoperable AI platform for LEAs, researchers, and industry, enabling continuous testing, integration, and development of AI-driven security solutions.
    3. Enhance cybersecurity measures for AI-based law enforcement technologies, protecting them from manipulation, cyber threats, and adversarial AI attacks.
    4. Develop AI-driven cybersecurity tools for threat intelligence, predictive analytics, and incident response, targeting LEAs, Cybercrime Units, and Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs).
    5. Address the dual nature of AI by developing resilience against adversarial AI and malicious AI usage in criminal and terrorist activities.
    6. Analyze existing LEA tools and systems to improve their capability in preventing, detecting, and responding to cyber threats and security incidents.
    7. Develop high-quality, up-to-date, and legally compliant training/testing datasets for AI-driven security applications, ensuring cross-border collaboration among LEAs and the scientific community.
    8. Conduct a comparative legal analysis of data-sharing regulations across Europe, identifying legislative barriers and proposing solutions for AI dataset accessibility while ensuring fundamental rights protection.
    9. Define ethical and operational guidelines for AI use in law enforcement, ensuring transparency, accountability, and compliance with EU regulations.
    10. Strengthen cooperation between LEAs, policymakers, and industry to promote knowledge exchange, best practices, and common AI security strategies across Europe.

    Recommend potential organisations suitable to form a consortium for the following project.
    
    Project Description:
    The development of medical devices and pharmaceutical products is an expensive and time-consuming process, with costs exceeding €2 billion per drug, mainly due to lengthy clinical trials. In-silico medicine, which leverages computer simulations for predictive toxicology, pharmacokinetics, and clinical testing, has the potential to reduce costs, accelerate drug development, and enhance patient safety. However, its adoption is hindered by lack of trust from regulatory authorities, healthcare professionals, industry stakeholders, and investors, who require proof of validation in real clinical settings.
    This project aims to accelerate the adoption of individualized computer simulations in the regulatory evaluation of medicines and medical devices, facilitating their translation into clinical practice and market approval. By developing scientifically validated and regulatory-compliant in-silico models, the initiative will support decision-making in drug development, improve safety and efficacy assessments, and reduce reliance on traditional clinical trials and animal testing. The project will also contribute to standardizing protocols and regulatory frameworks, ensuring widespread adoption of computational models in healthcare innovation.
    
    Project Objectives:
    1. Develop innovative computer modeling solutions for the testing and validation of medicines and/or medical devices, integrating expertise from computational modeling, bioinformatics, systems biology, pharmacology, and toxicology.
    2. Provide clinical validation of in-silico models through human trials, animal studies, in-vivo and in-vitro testing, and the use of biobanks to gain regulatory acceptance.
    3. Enhance regulatory trust in computer simulations by engaging with health authorities, industry stakeholders, and academia, ensuring compliance with regulatory frameworks.
    4. Improve patient safety and efficacy of medical treatments by integrating personalized, digitized, and data-driven simulation models into drug and medical device evaluation.
    5. Reduce the size, duration, and costs of clinical trials, enabling faster, more efficient drug development while minimizing ethical concerns related to human and animal testing.
    6. Optimize drug and medical device development by identifying failure points early, suggesting improvements, and enhancing the predictive power of computational models.
    7. Contribute to the redesign of clinical trials by incorporating in-silico methodologies, providing an alternative or complement to traditional testing approaches.
    8. Standardize protocols for computer-based testing to ensure interoperability, reproducibility, and regulatory compliance in clinical decision-making and product evaluation.
    9. Facilitate data-sharing and knowledge exchange by contributing to the European Cloud Initiative, making open, reusable in-silico models and clinical trial data available for further research and innovation.
    10. Encourage SME participation to foster technological innovation and commercialization of in-silico solutions, driving market adoption and industrial competitiveness.

    Recommend potential organisations suitable to form a consortium for the following project.
    
    Project Description:
    This project aims to enhance and professionalize the National Contact Points (NCPs) within Horizon Europe’s Cluster 3 – “Civil Security for Society”, ensuring harmonized support, improved cooperation, and greater accessibility to EU security research funding. By strengthening transnational collaboration, improving NCP capacity-building, and facilitating access to funding opportunities, this initiative will lower entry barriers for newcomers and improve the overall quality of proposals submitted.    
    The project will also streamline information exchange between EU institutions, Member States, and Associated Countries, reinforcing the integration of national and regional security R&I efforts into the broader European framework. Special attention will be given to engaging less experienced NCPs, fostering matchmaking activities, and increasing visibility of national players’ contributions to EU-funded security research.
    By leveraging data-driven insights and policy feedback mechanisms, the project will enhance the impact assessment of security research initiatives, ensuring better innovation uptake and improved strategic alignment with the European security landscape.
    
    Project Objectives:
        1.	Strengthen and harmonize NCP support services, ensuring high-quality, professionalized guidance across Europe to facilitate access to Horizon Europe calls.
        2.	Improve transnational cooperation between NCPs, particularly engaging Associated Countries and widening participants, to ensure consistent information flow and equal quality of service.
        3.	Enhance evidence-based policy feedback mechanisms, integrating national, regional, and local dimensions of security R&I into EU decision-making.
        4.	Assess the needs of stakeholders (e.g., researchers, industry, policymakers) to identify training opportunities and harmonized support mechanisms for security and cybersecurity research projects.
        5.	Increase collaboration between NCPs and the Enterprise Europe Network (EEN), leveraging matchmaking tools, brokerage events, and info days to link potential applicants with research consortia.
        6.	Develop tools to assess the impact of security research, including quantitative and qualitative evaluations of project participation, success stories, and innovation uptake.
        7.	Increase the visibility of national players in EU security research and innovation fora, highlighting results that have led to operational deployments or show strong potential for uptake.
        8.	Facilitate matchmaking activities to support widening countries, connecting potential participants with consortia via online platforms, bilateral meetings, and targeted events.
        9.	Ensure synergy with National Coordination Centres (NCCs) for Cybersecurity, aligning support activities to strengthen cross-border collaboration and industry participation.
        10.	Support the long-term sustainability of the NCP network, fostering knowledge transfer, best practices, and continuous training for both experienced and less experienced NCPs.
