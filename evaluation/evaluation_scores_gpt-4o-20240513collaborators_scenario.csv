        Project Description:
        'The project aims to advance Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Connected, Cooperative, and Automated Mobility (CCAM) by enhancing situational awareness, predictive decision-making, and safety in time-critical scenarios.
        The initiative will develop AI-driven solutions that integrate seamlessly with active safety systems while ensuring trustworthy, explainable, and human-centric AI to increase public acceptance and usability.
        The project will focus on predictive system state awareness, moving beyond current reactive and adaptive AI approaches to anticipatory AI-driven automation.
        By leveraging real and synthetic traffic datasets from across Europe, the project will accelerate AI training and validation, ensuring unbiased decision-making and mitigating risks associated with cyber threats, unintended miscommunication, and human-AI interactions.
        A multidisciplinary, cross-sectoral approach will ensure functional safety, security, and compliance with automotive standards.
        Collaboration with social sciences and humanities (SSH) experts will further improve the societal impact of AI-driven mobility solutions. 
        International partnerships with key stakeholders from the US, Japan, Canada, South Korea, Singapore, and Australia will foster global cooperation in advancing CCAM technology.'
    
        Project Objectives:
        • OBJ1: Develop AI-based situational awareness, prediction, and decision-making models to improve safety-critical CCAM applications.
        • OBJ2: Enhance AI training and validation methodologies by leveraging real and synthetic traffic event datasets, ensuring unbiased and ethical AI development.
        • OBJ3: Transition from reactive to predictive AI-based system awareness, improving driver state monitoring, user diversity adaptation, and proactive decision-making in near-critical road situations.
        • OBJ4: Improve human-AI interaction in CCAM, ensuring AI-driven systems are explainable, trustworthy, and human-like, free from gender, ethnic, and other biases.
        • OBJ5: Strengthen AI-driven traffic management and cybersecurity measures, integrating tactical and strategic safety protocols into transport systems.
        • OBJ6: Ensure functional safety and security compliance by developing automotive-grade AI solutions consistent with existing validation procedures and international standards.
        • OBJ7: Integrate Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) expertise to enhance the societal impact and acceptanceof AI in mobility applications.

    Identity potential collaborators for the following project details.

    Project Description:
    This project aims to accelerate the digital transformation of the energy sector by developing and piloting open-source, decentralized, and AI-driven energy data platforms. The initiative will contribute to the Digitalisation of Energy Action Plan by enabling innovative data-driven energy services through transparent, reliable, and interoperable data exchange mechanisms.
    The project will validate cutting-edge digital technologies such as Cloud-Edge continuum, AI/ML (federated learning), IoT, and swarm computing in real-world large-scale pilot environments across three EU Member States/Associated Countries. Solutions will focus on renewable energy integration, grid flexibility, and bi-directional EV charging while ensuring energy efficiency, resilience, and scalability.
    A key aspect of the project is the development and standardization of common European energy data frameworks, ensuring semantic interoperability with ETSI SAREF ontologies and alignment with European cloud-edge infrastructure and data spaces. The initiative will also foster SME-driven innovation, supporting third-party service development through open calls and financial support mechanisms.
    The project will collaborate with EU initiatives like BRIDGE, AIOTI, and Testing and Experimentation Facilities (TEF) for the energy sector, ensuring long-term market adoption, regulatory alignment, and industrial scalability of the developed solutions.

    Project Objectives:
    • OBJ1: Contribute to the Digitalisation of Energy Action Plan by developing open, interoperable, and AI-driven energy data platforms.
    • OBJ2: Improve renewable energy integration, local energy consumption, and grid flexibility through decentralized digital solutions.
    • OBJ3: Validate Cloud-Edge continuum, AI/ML (federated learning), IoT, and swarm computing technologies in large-scale pilot environments across at least three EU countries.
    • OBJ4: Establish European energy data standards by extending existing frameworks and filling standardization gaps, ensuring compliance with ETSI SAREF ontologies.
    • OBJ5: Ensure critical operational resilience of energy systems in low-battery, fault-tolerant, and harsh weather conditions.
    • OBJ6: Foster SME-driven innovation by allocating up to 10% of the total budget to an open call for additional third-party energy services.
    • OBJ7: Develop a market uptake plan to scale developed solutions across diverse European energy grids, supporting long-term adoption and commercial viability.
    • OBJ8: Actively contribute to EU initiatives like BRIDGE, AIOTI, and TEF, allocating up to 2% of the project budget for these collaborations.

    Recommend potential collaborators for the following project details.

    Project Description:
    This project aims to advance the next generation of smart systems by developing agile, secure, and decentralized architectures for collaborative smart nodes with swarm intelligence. It will leverage Europe’s strengths in embedded sensors, devices, and wireless communication (both non-cellular and 5G networks) to create interoperable and energy-efficient IoT and cyber-physical ecosystems.
    The project will focus on developing dynamic programming environments for smart edge-connected nodes, reducing the complexity of programming and maintenance across the device-edge-cloud continuum. By introducing mesh architectures, decentralized intelligence, and AI-powered edge processing, the project will enable context-aware, autonomous, and scalable IoT solutions.
    Through proof-of-concept implementations in at least three real-world application areas (e.g., automated driving, healthcare, smart factories, utilities, farming, logistics, or smart cities), the project will demonstrate higher resilience, security, and trust in embedded AI applications. The initiative will also prioritize energy efficiency and contribute to the sustainable use of energy by optimizing edge computing performance and promoting renewable energy sources.

    Project Objectives:
    • OBJ1: Develop secure, decentralized, and agile architectures for collaborative smart nodes with swarm intelligence in cyber-physical ecosystems.
    • OBJ2: Create programming environments that simplify the deployment and maintenance of smart edge-connected nodes across device-edge-cloud infrastructures.
    • OBJ3: Design and implement open, dynamic environments and tools that support interoperability, open architectures, and vendor neutrality, fostering open-source adoption where appropriate.
    • OBJ4: Strengthen Europe’s leadership in next-generation smart systems by integrating smart sensors, embedded processors, and AI-powered edge computing into scalable IoT applications.
    • OBJ5: Develop and validate innovative mesh architectures with mixed topologies that enable tactile internet, real-time analytics, and context-aware interaction.
    • OBJ6: Demonstrate the resilience, security, and trustworthiness of distributed AI applications through real-world proof-of-concept implementations in at least three sectors.
    • OBJ7: Optimize energy efficiency of edge computing solutions and promote renewable energy integration to ensure the sustainable development of IoT ecosystems.
    • OBJ8: Align with global sustainable development goals (SDGs) by promoting energy-efficient, secure, and decentralized IoT and cyber-physical ecosystems.

    Recommend potential collaborators for the following project details.

    Project Description:
    The development of medical devices and pharmaceutical products is an expensive and time-consuming process, with costs exceeding €2 billion per drug, mainly due to lengthy clinical trials. In-silico medicine, which leverages computer simulations for predictive toxicology, pharmacokinetics, and clinical testing, has the potential to reduce costs, accelerate drug development, and enhance patient safety. However, its adoption is hindered by lack of trust from regulatory authorities, healthcare professionals, industry stakeholders, and investors, who require proof of validation in real clinical settings.
    This project aims to accelerate the adoption of individualized computer simulations in the regulatory evaluation of medicines and medical devices, facilitating their translation into clinical practice and market approval. By developing scientifically validated and regulatory-compliant in-silico models, the initiative will support decision-making in drug development, improve safety and efficacy assessments, and reduce reliance on traditional clinical trials and animal testing. The project will also contribute to standardizing protocols and regulatory frameworks, ensuring widespread adoption of computational models in healthcare innovation.

    Project Objectives:
    1. Develop innovative computer modeling solutions for the testing and validation of medicines and/or medical devices, integrating expertise from computational modeling, bioinformatics, systems biology, pharmacology, and toxicology.
    2. Provide clinical validation of in-silico models through human trials, animal studies, in-vivo and in-vitro testing, and the use of biobanks to gain regulatory acceptance.
    3. Enhance regulatory trust in computer simulations by engaging with health authorities, industry stakeholders, and academia, ensuring compliance with regulatory frameworks.
    4. Improve patient safety and efficacy of medical treatments by integrating personalized, digitized, and data-driven simulation models into drug and medical device evaluation.
    5. Reduce the size, duration, and costs of clinical trials, enabling faster, more efficient drug development while minimizing ethical concerns related to human and animal testing.
    6. Optimize drug and medical device development by identifying failure points early, suggesting improvements, and enhancing the predictive power of computational models.
    7. Contribute to the redesign of clinical trials by incorporating in-silico methodologies, providing an alternative or complement to traditional testing approaches.
    8. Standardize protocols for computer-based testing to ensure interoperability, reproducibility, and regulatory compliance in clinical decision-making and product evaluation.
    9. Facilitate data-sharing and knowledge exchange by contributing to the European Cloud Initiative, making open, reusable in-silico models and clinical trial data available for further research and innovation.
    10. Encourage SME participation to foster technological innovation and commercialization of in-silico solutions, driving market adoption and industrial competitiveness.

    Recommend potential collaborators for the following project details.

    Project Description:
    This project aims to develop and integrate European supercomputing technologies into pilot exascale systems, demonstrating their performance, scalability, power efficiency, and resilience in pre-operational environments. These pilot systems will serve as prototypes capable of executing real-world workloads, running European hardware and software components, and providing a foundation for future exascale computing architectures.
    Two complementary supercomputing pilots will be developed:
    1. One leveraging European low-power general-purpose processors, such as those from the European Processor Initiative (EPI).
    2. Another based on European open hardware solutions, supporting diverse accelerator technologies, including RISC-V-based components.
    These pilot systems will ensure deep integration of European technologies, including interconnects, cooling, software stacks, and application development environments. They will be designed with a strong co-design approach, driven by extreme data and high-performance computing (HPC) applications, ensuring that European exascale systems are built on energy-efficient, open-source, and interoperable solutions.

    Project Objectives:
    1. Develop two complementary pilot exascale supercomputing systems, integrating European technologies and demonstrating their feasibility in real-world scenarios.
    2. Maximize the use of European hardware and software technologies, including low-power processors, open hardware components, and software tools from previous EU-funded projects.
    3. Ensure scalability and energy efficiency, optimizing architectures to reduce power consumption while maintaining high computational performance.
    4. Implement innovative cooling technologies, integrating and testing advanced liquid cooling, immersion cooling, and hybrid approaches to enhance efficiency.
    5. Design robust, resilient, and adaptable system architectures, ensuring that pilot supercomputers can withstand failures and self-optimize under varying workloads.
    6. Develop a comprehensive European software stack, supporting heterogeneous computing environments and integrating compilers, programming models, and optimization tools for high-performance applications.
    7. Identify and integrate ambitious application use cases, ensuring close collaboration with application developers, industry, and user communities to drive co-design efforts.
    8. Define measurable performance targets, including power efficiency, computing density, scalability, resilience, and application performance improvements, ensuring continuous benchmarking and validation.
    9. Foster interoperability between pilot systems, establishing common hardware/software frameworks, programming environments, and architectural guidelines to ensure convergence of European supercomputing efforts.

    Recommend potential collaborators for the following project details.

    Project Description:
    This project aims to enhance sustainability and competitiveness in food systems through the deployment of digital and data-driven technologies. By leveraging private-sector and public data, the initiative will support better decision-making, consumer engagement, and governance in alignment with European Green Deal priorities, the EU’s 2030 and 2050 climate targets, and the Farm to Fork strategy. The project will also contribute to the Food 2030 priorities, ensuring sustainable diets, climate resilience, resource efficiency, and transparency in food systems.
    By analyzing existing data-sharing mechanisms, fostering new data-driven business models, and integrating AI and analytics, this initiative will identify key sustainability drivers, improve consumer choices, and create a structured framework for responsible data sharing. This will accelerate the transition towards sustainable food systems, while ensuring privacy, business integrity, and adherence to EU policies.

    Project Objectives:
    1. Analyze existing private-sector data-sharing models in food systems, identifying monetary incentives, involved actors, and regulatory challenges.
    2. Test potential data-sharing strategies involving SMEs, startups, and food industry stakeholders to assess their impact, feasibility, and benefits.
    3. Identify and integrate new, underutilized data sources from unconventional players, outlining a data collection strategy that enhances sustainability insights.
    4. Develop AI-driven analytics, forecasting, and decision-support tools to help consumers and businesses make informed, sustainable choices.
    5. Assess the impact of proposed data-driven solutions on food system sustainability, evaluating environmental, social, and economic factors across the entire supply chain.
    6. Create digital tools to guide consumers at the point of purchase, ensuring alignment with EU food law and sustainability policies.
    7. Establish a framework for non-competitive data sharing, defining principles, best practices, and methods for integrating shared data into the Smart Communities Data Space.
    8. Ensure multi-actor collaboration, involving health professionals, SMEs, startups, and policymakers, to drive a holistic and impactful transformation.
    9. Collaborate with other EU-funded initiatives, particularly those focusing on citizen empowerment in food and nutrition data rights and food waste reduction.
    10. Incorporate social innovation approaches, recognizing the socio-technical nature of sustainability and the need for behavioral shifts, new social practices, and community engagement.

    Recommend potential collaborators for the following project details.

    Project Description:
    This project aims to enhance and professionalize the National Contact Points (NCPs) within Horizon Europe’s Cluster 3 – “Civil Security for Society”, ensuring harmonized support, improved cooperation, and greater accessibility to EU security research funding. By strengthening transnational collaboration, improving NCP capacity-building, and facilitating access to funding opportunities, this initiative will lower entry barriers for newcomers and improve the overall quality of proposals submitted.    
    The project will also streamline information exchange between EU institutions, Member States, and Associated Countries, reinforcing the integration of national and regional security R&I efforts into the broader European framework. Special attention will be given to engaging less experienced NCPs, fostering matchmaking activities, and increasing visibility of national players’ contributions to EU-funded security research.
    By leveraging data-driven insights and policy feedback mechanisms, the project will enhance the impact assessment of security research initiatives, ensuring better innovation uptake and improved strategic alignment with the European security landscape.

    Project Objectives:
        1.	Strengthen and harmonize NCP support services, ensuring high-quality, professionalized guidance across Europe to facilitate access to Horizon Europe calls.
        2.	Improve transnational cooperation between NCPs, particularly engaging Associated Countries and widening participants, to ensure consistent information flow and equal quality of service.
        3.	Enhance evidence-based policy feedback mechanisms, integrating national, regional, and local dimensions of security R&I into EU decision-making.
        4.	Assess the needs of stakeholders (e.g., researchers, industry, policymakers) to identify training opportunities and harmonized support mechanisms for security and cybersecurity research projects.
        5.	Increase collaboration between NCPs and the Enterprise Europe Network (EEN), leveraging matchmaking tools, brokerage events, and info days to link potential applicants with research consortia.
        6.	Develop tools to assess the impact of security research, including quantitative and qualitative evaluations of project participation, success stories, and innovation uptake.
        7.	Increase the visibility of national players in EU security research and innovation fora, highlighting results that have led to operational deployments or show strong potential for uptake.
        8.	Facilitate matchmaking activities to support widening countries, connecting potential participants with consortia via online platforms, bilateral meetings, and targeted events.
        9.	Ensure synergy with National Coordination Centres (NCCs) for Cybersecurity, aligning support activities to strengthen cross-border collaboration and industry participation.
        10.	Support the long-term sustainability of the NCP network, fostering knowledge transfer, best practices, and continuous training for both experienced and less experienced NCPs.
